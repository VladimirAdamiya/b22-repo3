We just published our local git repo
 to remote github.com repository
Few things happened
1. Its automaticallu created new Remote Repo under your GitHub.com account
2. Made the connection with your local git repo
3. Added all your commits to remote repo

Now I am continue to work locally
And then will push changes to GitHub.com
